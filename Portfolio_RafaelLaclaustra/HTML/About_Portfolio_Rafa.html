          <h3>Welcome to my portfolio...</h3>
          <p>
            I began in 2D classical animation. 3D interested me from the moment I knew of it's existence. At the first opportunity I began to study it, the need to animate characters meant that I had to learn 

modelling and rigging. Later I realised that in order to make the exterior appearance interesting I began to study lighting and shading. Fluids were another discovery, outside my prior knowledge 

and even though I had no experience I couldn't resist mastering them. Thus, today I can offer myself as an animator, 3D generalist who is able to work with fluids.

            Today, IÂ´m working as a freelance and sometimes working with Illion on films like "Big Foot" and "Atrapa la bandera".

            I have also worked with great artists such as Christian Dan and Pepe Mansuy in films like Marvel's "Thor Ragnarok" working as a     generalist and giving life to characters like Thanos. Lately I am making great advances in the world of the VFX in blockbuster movies like The Hobbit and Super Lopez.
